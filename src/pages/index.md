_Hello World!_

　　 When I was dreaming about you baby
　　 You were dreaming of me
　　 Call me crazy
　　 Call me blind
　　 To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time
　　 Did I lose my love to someone better
　　 And does she love you like I do
　　 I do, you know I really really do
　　 Well hey
　　 So much I need to say
　　 Been lonely since the day
　　 The day you went away
　　 So sad but true
